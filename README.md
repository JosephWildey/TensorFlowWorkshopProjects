# TensorFlowWorkshopProjects

# Activities
These are activities in the workbook. They are basically exercises with a step-by-step guide.

# Exercises
These are often a lot like the activities, but executing each step is completely up to you. There is no step-by-step guide.

# Projects
These are projects I have decided to undertake inspired by the Tensorflow Workshop
