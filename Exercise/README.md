# Naming Convention
The chapter and exercise number within that chapter are represented numerically (x.0y), where x is the chapter, and y is the challenge's number within that chapter. e.g., Chapter 1, Exercise 2 is: 1.02

The title now seeks to summarize the goal of the exercise.  

# Tensorboard Proof (Exercise 3.xx)
I do not have a convenient way of uploading the 3.01 exercise as a completely dynamic tensorboard, so here is a static graph it generated.
